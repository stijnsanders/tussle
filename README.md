# tussle

Something quickly whipped up over a weekend.
Nothing fancy, just a rip-off of a well-known strategic board game, but with 30 instead of 40 pieces per team to have a bit shorter play time per game. (And a number of other changes that will make this enough of a distinct game so I won't risk take-down notices, I hope.)

Created with [xxm](https://github.com/stijnsanders/xxm#xxm). I first had a version based on a WebSocket, but Firefox is no longer allowing this without secure connection, so I switched to long polling and the [fetch API](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/API/Fetch_API/Using_Fetch).

Enjoy.

# tussle â€” To-Do's

* deduplicate code Signal1/Signal2 (use coordinate modifiers to 'rotate' player 2)
* more tinkering protection
* more (any, really) information about 'lost' connection or game state
* 'store' previous setups using pushstate

## maybe 

* re-do in nodejs/D/Go to get to know that better
* use tiles images (does that work with svg?)
* or use all SVG
* or canvas 2D
* or canvas 3D ?

## maybe maybe

* unit tests
* play against the computer?
* keep score, game history (user accounts?)
